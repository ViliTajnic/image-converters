# image-converters
Python script to convert images from different formats using Python Pillow

These scripts can be uses as following:
script_name.py "Input folder path" "Output folder path"

Currently there are just two conversions defined:
from EPS to PNG formats
from JPEG to PNG formats.

It is capable of finding the correct image formats in a folder and then converting them to the requested image type to another folder defined.

If you want me to add more file fomats like .gif, tiff, bmp, raw, ... please let me know. 
Cheers!
